INTRODUCTION:
When the body’s cells start dividing without stopping and spread into the surrounding tissues it results in cancer. Cancer can start anywhere in the human body and one such cancer is breast cancer. Breast cancer is very common among women all over the world. For the year 2019 there have been 2.09 million cases all over the world with around 627000 deaths. Early diagnosis of the disease and giving the necessary treatment can result in early recovery. There has also been an increase in the number of cases each year and this is a matter of concern. In order to monitor for signs of the disease, screening once a year is highly recommended. The tumors can be either benign or malignant. Benign are the tumors which are not harmful and do not spread to the surrounding tissues while malignant are the cancerous tumors.
Early detection of cancer is essential for a rapid response and better chances of cure. Unfortunately, early detection of cancer is often difﬁcult because the symptoms of the disease at the beginning are absent. Thus, it is necessary to discover and interpret new knowledge to prevent and minimize the risk adverse consequences. Hence, in this project the main goal is to determine the tumor and find out if it is a benign or a malignant one!
